# Java Calculator

By Lucas Lee

# Evaluator

The evaluator is designed to handle complex numbers.

It will process addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, cos, sin, and tan of complex inputs

Please keep in mind the order of operations and also ensure that there are no implied operations

This calculator uses radians. Use the custom function "torad()" in the input for conversion to radians (e.g. 'sin(torad(30))' will return 0.5 + 0.0i)

Answers can be checked on Wolfram Alpha

Some examples to run
+ (1+2i)^(3+4i)
+ sin(1+3i)
+ ((4 - 2^3 + 1) * -sqrt(-3\*3-4\*4+3i)) ^(2+3i) + cos(torad(30))^2
+ e^(i \* pi)

# Polynomial Equations

This will find the intersection in a Polynomial equation with complex coefficients as well as the derivative of the resulting function

Each term uses the evaluator similar to the one already used
